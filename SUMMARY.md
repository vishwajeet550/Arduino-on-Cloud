# Arduino-on-Cloud

I use Tinkercad for simulation.
First I saw the LED Blinking tutorial then I undersand the connections and code in Block and Text mode also.
In Buzer practical I make change that I replace LED with Buzer and connect Buzer with or without resistor and then build the code in Block as well as text also.     

code for Buzer insted of LED - 

// C++ code
//
void setup()
{
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
